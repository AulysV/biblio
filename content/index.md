# Bonjour 👋

You've just landed on a library of notes ranging from the [philosophy of stupidity](Liste/La-bêtise) to the [usefulness of analog calculation in solving differential equations](Liste/TIPE). All notes are in French (cocorico 🐓). 

They're made for the future me, but you can take advantage of them if you find them interesting.
