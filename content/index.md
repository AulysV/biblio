title: Bibliothèque de notes

(**🏗️ Site en construction**)

You've just landed on a library of notes ranging from the philosophy of stupidity to the usefulness of analog calculation in solving differential equations. All notes are in French (cocorico). 

They're made for the future me, but you can take advantage of them if you find them interesting.

There's a "Backlinks" category that lets you select notes which are "parents" to the one you're reading.
There's also a "graphs" category that displays an interactive tree structure of the notes.
