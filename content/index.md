# Bonjour 👋

You've just landed on a library of notes ranging from the [philosophy of stupidity](Liste/La-bêtise) to the [usefulness of analog calculation in solving differential equations](Liste/TIPE). I share my thoughts and personal experiences, so they're mainly made for myself. But you can take a look at them if you find them interesting. 

Please come and insult me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/637695900382134303) or by [mail](mailto:contact@aulysv.fr) about my opinons or typos. I'll be happy to insult you in return!

> [!info]- Info for low IQ readers
> *Why would you open it?* 🤦🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️
> Anyway:
> - The site is designed to work on a large screen (sorry mobile users)
> ![[layout.svg]]
> - Light mode is awful
> - The graph below is interactive 😉
> - You can also comment below by logging into your GitHub account
> - All notes are in French (cocorico 🐓). I suggest you to translate them (extension in the browser for exemple), unless you want to practice your french
